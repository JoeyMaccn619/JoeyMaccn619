My name is Jose but I prefer to be called Joey
I am currently a senior learning coding on my own with C++ taking a free edX course by Harvard
Im interested in the field of software development and would like to be hopefully a software engineer or just build websites or games in the later future. 
I will update my contact info once I'm more settled in!
Thank you for reading this!
